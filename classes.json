This course will provide students with an understanding of the principles of Servant Leadership (Greenleaf, 1970, 1998, 2001) and an exploration of adaptive leadership theory and practice (Heifetz, 1994, 2001, 2009). These two leadership theories in tandem provide a uniquely Jesuit approach to leadership, with servant leadership cultivating the heart, while adaptive leadership provides an avenue for the head and hands. A focal point of the course is on helping students begin to develop a vision of their vocation as leaders by participating in real-time, casein-point examples of adaptive leadership. As a capstone to the Minor in Leadership Studies, students will practice their leadership skills and knowledge in a legacy project and construct a learning portfolio from their coursework.

We will cover such selected topics in organizational communication research, such as culture, socialization, systems theory, communication and technology, and globalization. \r\n"}, {"id": 166347, "subject": "ORGL", "subjectDescription": "ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP", "courseReferenceNumber": "11822", "courseNumber": "506", "scheduleTypeDescription": "Lecture", "courseTitle": "Leadership and Diversity", "maximumEnrollment": 24, "enrollment": 7, "seatsAvailable": 17, "waitCapacity": 24, "waitCount": 0, "waitAvailable": 24, "professorName": "Hayes, Tracey", "professorEmail": "hayest@gonzaga.edu", "beginTime": [null], "buildingDescription": ["Via Asynchronously"], "campusDescription": "Main", "category": ["01"], "creditHourSession": [3.0], "endDate": ["10/21/2022"], "endTime": [null], "hoursWeek": [3.0], "room": ["INTERNET"], "startDate": ["08/30/2022"], "sunday": [false], "monday": [false], "tuesday": [false], "wednesday": [false], "thursday": [false], "friday": [false], "saturday": [false], "instructionalMethodDescription": "On-line Asynchronous only", "attributeCodes": ["GELE", "GREQ"], "attributeDesc": ["Graduate credit", "Graduate Degree Requirement"], "description": "\r\nWho we are, whether we are comfortable with this idea or not, is shaped in part by the social roles we occupy and how society sees us in those roles.

Such responses are grounded in discernment regarding human conflict, oppression, power, and harm, and the opportunities&mdash;personal, familial, societal, and global&mdash;that rise from the crucible of potential that is our humanity.  \nI&rsquo;d like students to gain knowledge in three ways.  First, begin to appreciate the depth of heart, thought, and spirit necessary for a person to do long term, hopeful and efficacious work inside any system, be it personal, societal, or global, when that system is initially locked in an oppressive or harmful cycle.   The personal character required to live from a meaningful or purposeful approach regarding what it means to be human creates complexities and potentialities that invite the student toward joy, courage, and sacredness, even or perhaps in the words of Victor Frankl especially in the midst of human suffering.   Second, students will begin the process of understanding leadership (specifically servant-leadership), justice (conceptions of restorative vs. retributive justice) and forgiveness in the context of systems change toward reconciliation and depth of heart, mind, and spirit.  Third, students will work to apply the interior leadership necessary for discernment and action within oppressive systems.\nIn this course, therefore, each student will engage the following questions:\n&bull; What are the basic understandings of servant-leadership, restorative justice and forgiveness? \n&bull; How can a person choose servant-leadership, restorative justice and forgiveness in the face of grave human atrocities and the furthest reaches of human suffering?\n&bull; Who does one forgive, and how does one approach forgiveness?\n&bull; What does it mean to be a person of restorative justice and forgiveness?\n \r\n"}, {"id": 166195, "subject": "ORGL", "subjectDescription": "ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP", "courseReferenceNumber": "11308", "courseNumber": "535", "scheduleTypeDescription": "Lecture", "courseTitle": "Listen, Discern, Decide", "maximumEnrollment": 24, "enrollment": 13, "seatsAvailable": 11, "waitCapacity": 24, "waitCount": 0, "waitAvailable": 24, "professorName": "Tran, Dung", "professorEmail": "trand4@gonzaga.edu", "beginTime": [null], "buildingDescription": ["Via Asynchronously"], "campusDescription": "Main", "category": ["01"], "creditHourSession": [3.0], "endDate": ["10/21/2022"], "endTime": [null], "hoursWeek": [3.0], "room": ["INTERNET"], "startDate": ["08/30/2022"], "sunday": [false], "monday": [false], "tuesday": [false], "wednesday": [false], "thursday": [false], "friday": [false], "saturday": [false], "instructionalMethodDescription": "On-line Asynchronous only", "attributeCodes": ["GELE"], "attributeDesc": ["Graduate credit"], "description": "\r\nIn this class, students will learn more in-depth concepts of Servant-leadership by learning practices and approaches for listening and discerning as a way of enhancing decision-making capacity.

Activities included also present opportunities for taking leadership roles, recognizing leadership styles, identifying what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work in given situations, and applying learning to real life situations.  \n \r\n"}, {"id": 166461, "subject": "ORGL", "subjectDescription": "ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP", "courseReferenceNumber": "12583", "courseNumber": "570", "scheduleTypeDescription": "Lecture", "courseTitle": "Introduction to Global Systems", "maximumEnrollment": 24, "enrollment": 7, "seatsAvailable": 17, "waitCapacity": 24, "waitCount": 0, "waitAvailable": 24, "professorName": "Popa, Adrian", "professorEmail": "popa@gonzaga.edu", "beginTime": [null], "buildingDescription": ["Via Asynchronously"], "campusDescription": "Main", "category": ["01"], "creditHourSession": [3.0], "endDate": ["10/21/2022"], "endTime": [null], "hoursWeek": [3.0], "room": ["INTERNET"], "startDate": ["08/30/2022"], "sunday": [false], "monday": [false], "tuesday": [false], "wednesday": [false], "thursday": [false], "friday": [false], "saturday": [false], "instructionalMethodDescription": "On-line Asynchronous only", "attributeCodes": ["GELE"], "attributeDesc": ["Graduate credit"], "description": "\r\nWe exist in a rapidly shrinking world of intensifying technological, economic, social, cultural, and political interconnections.

Metaphysical issues about the mind and body relationship, the nature and extent of free will, and the nature of personal identity will be included. Some epistemological issues having to do with how well we can expect to have access to reality, and what might be among the impediments to the access will also be included. The course generally avoids treating ethical or moral issues, but also takes an interest in the use of the emotions in films, the treatment of violence and human sexuality in films and the nature of comedy in films. Some attention will also be given to film techniques, especially from the point of view of the audience. \r\n"}, {"id": 166969, "subject": "PHIL", "subjectDescription": "PHILOSOPHY", "courseReferenceNumber": "15171", "courseNumber": "491", "scheduleTypeDescription": "Lecture", "courseTitle": "Science and Society", "maximumEnrollment": 22, "enrollment": 2, "seatsAvailable": 20, "waitCapacity": 0, "waitCount": 0, "waitAvailable": 0, "professorName": "Turnbull, Greta", "professorEmail": "turnbull@gonzaga.edu", "beginTime": ["1310"], "buildingDescription": ["College Hall"], "campusDescription": "Main", "category": ["01"], "creditHourSession": [3.0], "endDate": ["12/16/2022"], "endTime": ["1400"], "hoursWeek": [2.5], "room": ["304"], "startDate": ["08/30/2022"], "sunday": [false], "monday": [true], "tuesday": [false], "wednesday": [true], "thursday": [false], "friday": [true], "saturday": [false], "instructionalMethodDescription": "Classroom Face-to-Face only", "attributeCodes": ["CRAS", "ELEC", "HEAL", "UCIS"], "attributeDesc": ["Arts & Sciences Credit", "Undergraduate credit", "HEAL -
